Hello!

In this project, I will attempt to show you how to create a basic MERN (MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js) Stack application. In order to run the project download it and open with any code editor(my preference is Visual Studio)
Then run the below command in sequence.

1. npm install                 // Install dependencies for REACT
2. cd backend && npm install   // Go to backend folder and install dependencies
3. npm start                   // run REACT 
3. npm run server              // run NODE 

 Before you test this out make sure to change the mongoURI and secret key
